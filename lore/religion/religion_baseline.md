## Prevalence
Religious practice is routine and woven into daily life. Ritual observance commonly occurs on a weekly basis or more frequently. Most people observe some form of faith practice.

## Visibility
Faith is commonly displayed publicly through ritual, shrine upkeep, and visible observance. Religious expression is a normal part of communal life rather than a private or hidden practice.

## Places of Worship
Temples, shrines, and places of worship are common across settlements. Their size and influence vary, and they are not uniformly organized or governed.

## Clergy
The precise role of clergy differs by faith and locality. Their influence may range from advisory to ceremonial to practical, depending on context. No single clerical model dominates the region.

## Tolerance
Tolerance of belief depends largely on the deity or tradition involved, consistent with the diversity of the wider pantheon. Differences in faith are expected and generally accommodated, though not universally embraced.

## Notes
This file establishes religious behavior and presence, not doctrine or divine hierarchy.
