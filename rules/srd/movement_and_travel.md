# Movement and Travel (Tactical)

id: rules_movement_travel_35e
type: rules
system: dnd35e

## Tactical Movement
- Normal movement: up to speed as a move action
- Difficult terrain: movement costs double
- Charging and running require open space

## Overland Travel
Distance covered depends on:
- Speed
- Terrain
- Load carried
- Time spent traveling

## Encumbrance
Heavier loads reduce movement speed and may impose penalties.

## Swimming and Climbing
These generally require skill checks, especially under stress or while armored.

## Notes
Travel rules support pacing and risk, not exhaustive simulation.
