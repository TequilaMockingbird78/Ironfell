id: story_seed_008
type: story_seed
canon: hard
status: unresolved
region: region_001

## Overview
Reports have surfaced of unsettling rituals conducted in the ruins of an old, desecrated site beyond regular patrol routes.

## Known Signs
- Unquiet dead appearing near isolated paths
- Symbols carved or painted in forgotten religious iconography
- Faint chanting heard at night by nearby travelers

## Suspected Actors
A small sect of dark clerics is believed to be using the site, though their number and affiliations are unclear.

## Purpose (Uncertain)
Speculation includes:
- Experiments in controlling undead
- Attempts to consecrate the site to a forbidden power
- Deliberate harassment of the populace to provoke fear or response

## Impact
- Fear among outlying hamlets
- Disrupted travel after nightfall
- Requests for protection or investigation from shrine keepers

## Current Status
The activity appears intermittent, as if the group is testing boundaries rather than acting openly.

## Resolution Conditions
This situation may change if:
- The ruins are investigated or sanctified
- The clerics are confronted, dispersed, or co-opted
- Local religious or secular authorities intervene
- The undead activity escalates beyond containment
