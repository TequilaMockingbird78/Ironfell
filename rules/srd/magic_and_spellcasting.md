## Spellcasting
Casting a spell generally requires:
- A spell slot
- Appropriate components (verbal, somatic, material)
- A standard action unless noted otherwise

## Concentration
If damaged or distracted while casting, a concentration check may be required to avoid losing the spell.

## Spell Resistance
Some creatures have spell resistance (SR). To affect them, a caster must succeed on a caster level check.

## Saving Throws
Many spells allow a saving throw:
- Fortitude: physical resilience
- Reflex: agility and reaction
- Will: mental resolve

A successful save may negate or reduce effects.

## Notes
Magic resolves mechanically but should be narrated contextually.
