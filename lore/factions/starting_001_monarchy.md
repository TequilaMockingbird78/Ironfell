## Structure
Ruled by a feudal dwarven monarchy. Authority flows from the Crown through oath-bound nobles who control lands, strongholds, and river crossings.

Laws are enforced through custom, precedent, and sworn obligation rather than centralized bureaucracy. Lords are expected to maintain order within their holdings and answer directly to the Crown.

## Priorities
The monarchy prioritizes:
- Stability of trade routes
- Maintenance of strongholds
- Balance between rival noble houses

## Red Lines
- Threats to the Crown’s legitimacy
- Disruption of river trade
