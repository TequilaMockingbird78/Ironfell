# Magic Norms (region_id: starting_region_001)

## Prevalence
Magic is widespread and openly practiced. Most settlements can access minor magical services through hedge wizards or guild-trained mages.

## Institutions
Mage guilds and magical schools exist with Crown-recognized charters. Guilds cooperate with nobles when magic affects irrigation, trade, and stronghold defense.

## Social Expectations
Mages are respected as skilled tradespeople and advisors, not as rulers. Magic that interferes with oaths, rightful claims, or adjudication is culturally taboo.

## Common Uses
- Irrigation and waterfinding
- Protection of caravans and river traffic
- Stonecraft enhancement and defensive wards
