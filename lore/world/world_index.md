# World Index — Western Shores

id: world_index_001  
type: world_index  
canon: hard

## Purpose
This index defines the immediate known world surrounding the explorers’ landing area. It establishes scale and adjacency without defining outcomes or importance.

## Known Regions
- region_001: Central valley corridor (starting region)
- region_002: Northern forest plains
- region_003: Southern wetlands and hills
- region_004: Desert city-state

## Scale
These regions represent only a small portion of the continent. Their borders imply further lands beyond, not yet described.

## Oceans and Coasts
The eastern coastline marks the explorers’ point of arrival. The interior extends westward, northward, and southward beyond the currently defined regions.

## Travel Expectations
- Overland travel between adjacent regions is feasible but shaped by terrain
- Rivers and established routes influence movement more than borders

## Notes
This world is incomplete by design. Additional regions may be defined as exploration continues.
