## Overview
A gnomish inventor has recently arrived in the region with an experimental device capable of reproducing text using carved tiles and pressure. The invention has drawn unwanted attention.

## Incident
At a local inn, an aggressive humanoid creditor publicly assaults the inventor, hurling him through the doorway and scattering dozens of carved tiles across the floor. The creditor demands repayment of an investment, threatening severe consequences if payment is not made soon.

## Known Parties
- A gnomish inventor, bruised but fiercely protective of his work
- A violent creditor, acting with confidence and little fear of reprisal
- Inn patrons who witnessed the incident but are hesitant to intervene

## The Invention
The device is incomplete but functional enough to demonstrate rapid duplication of written material. Its implications are not fully understood by most locals.

## Tensions
- The inventor insists the device is not yet profitable
- The creditor believes repayment is overdue and inevitable
- Others may see opportunity, danger, or heresy in the invention itself

## Current Status
The inventor remains in the area, attempting to recover scattered components and avoid further confrontation.

## Resolution Conditions
This situation may change if:
- The debt is settled, transferred, or nullified
- The inventor gains protection or patronage
- The invention is seized, destroyed, or completed
- The creditor is confronted or removed
