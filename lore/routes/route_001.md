# Route 001 — Valley and Western Road (UNNAMED)

id: route_001
type: route
canon: hard

## Overview
A primary route network connecting settlements within the valley and extending toward neighboring regions. Movement follows both river corridors and established overland paths.

## Nature of the Route
The route is partly river-based, using navigable stretches where possible, and partly overland. Its full extent is not universally known, particularly where rivers continue beyond familiar territory.

## Connected Regions
- Region 001 (valley corridor)
- Region 004 (western desert city-state)
- Indirect or uncertain connections to other regions

## Usage
The route is used by:
- Traders
- Locals traveling between settlements
- Messengers and caravans

## Dependence
Settlements rely on this route for the exchange of goods, tools, and information. While alternatives exist, disruption to the route affects daily life.

## Reliability
Travel along the route is generally predictable but subject to seasonal conditions, especially weather-related disruptions near rivers and hills.

## Neutrality
The route is treated as shared and customary rather than strictly owned. Respect for its use is enforced by precedent and practice more than centralized authority.
