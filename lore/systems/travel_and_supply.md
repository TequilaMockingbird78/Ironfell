# Travel and Supply Norms

## Purpose
Defines baseline expectations for travel, survival, and logistics within the starting region and its immediate surroundings.

## Water
Fresh water is available year-round along the region’s rivers. Away from rivers, water can still be found in pools, small lakes, and seasonal catchments, though doing so requires local knowledge or observation of animal behavior. Locals and wildlife alike tend to follow established watering places.

Finding water is mildly difficult for outsiders but rarely impossible.

## Food
Game animals exist but are migratory and unreliable due to seasonal movement toward water sources. Hunting and foraging can supplement supplies but should not be relied upon exclusively. Travelers typically carry food, trade for it, or combine multiple methods depending on circumstance.

## Shelter
Exposure is generally not a serious threat. The landscape provides natural shelter through hills, caves, stone outcrops, and shallow valleys. Weather can complicate travel but rarely renders survival impossible without extreme negligence.

## Movement
Travel commonly uses:
- Foot travel
- Pack animals
- Rivercraft where rivers permit

Small roads and well-worn paths exist throughout the region, reflecting long habitation and routine movement between settlements.

## Environmental Challenges
The land is broadly benign, but weather presents periodic challenges. Seasonal rains can cause flooding or mudslides in hills and along riverbanks, temporarily altering routes and access.

## Rest and Recovery
Safe rest in the wild is generally achievable with basic preparation. Travelers who understand the terrain and weather can find defensible or sheltered campsites without great difficulty.
