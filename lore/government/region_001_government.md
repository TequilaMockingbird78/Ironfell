type: government  
canon: hard

## High Thane
The High Thane rules from the primary stronghold and holds ultimate authority over charters, land grants, and dispute arbitration. Power is inherited but constrained by tradition and precedent.

## Local Lords
Six local lords hold fealty to the High Thane. Each controls:
- A stronghold, village cluster, or key resource zone
- Local justice and levy rights
- Obligations of defense and tribute

Lords are largely autonomous within their holdings.

## Administration
Governance is executed through written charters, oaths, and record-keeping. Spoken decrees are rare and typically ceremonial.

## Stability
The system prioritizes endurance over reform. Change occurs slowly, often through inheritance disputes, charter reinterpretation, or external pressure.
