## Seasonal Character

### Spring (Verdantis–Bloomtide)
A season of renewal and risk. Rivers run high, travel resumes, and new ventures begin. Many cultures associate Spring with vows, blessings, and first movements into the wider world.

### Summer (Suncrest–Highflame)
The height of activity. Trade flourishes, roads are busiest, and conflicts—both martial and political—are often pursued while conditions favor movement and supply.

### Autumn (Reapfall–Leafturn)
A season of reckoning and preparation. Harvests are gathered, accounts are settled, and communities prepare for the constraints of winter. Judgments and long-term decisions are often rendered before the cold.

### Winter (Frostbound–Thawmeet)
A time of hardship and inward focus. Travel slows or ceases, and attention turns to survival, memory, and ritual. Thawmeet signals anticipation rather than warmth—the promise of return rather than its fulfillment.
