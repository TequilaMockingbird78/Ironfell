# Religion (region_id: starting_region_001)

## Prevalence
Religion is a regular part of life. Most villages maintain at least one place of worship.

## Role in Society
Clergy primarily serve as custodians of tradition, oath-witnesses, mediators of disputes, and caretakers of the dead. Faith reinforces continuity rather than political dominance.

## Sacred Themes
- Oaths and rightful obligation
- Endurance through hardship
- Balance between clan duty and individual conduct

## Points of Tension
Religious authorities may conflict with noble houses when oaths are broken, burial rites are violated, or water rights are abused.
