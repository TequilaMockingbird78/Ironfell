## Skill Checks
A skill check is:
d20 + skill ranks + ability modifier + modifiers

The result is compared to a Difficulty Class (DC).

## Typical DC Ranges
- DC 5: Very easy
- DC 10: Easy
- DC 15: Typical
- DC 20: Difficult
- DC 25+: Very difficult or exceptional

## Taking 10
If not threatened or distracted, a character may take 10 instead of rolling.

## Taking 20
If time permits and failure carries no penalty, a character may take 20.

## Opposed Checks
When two creatures compete, both roll and the higher result succeeds.

## Notes
Skill checks represent uncertainty, not inevitability.
