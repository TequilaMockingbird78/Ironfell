canon: hard
status: unresolved

## Overview
A partially collapsed stone structure lies along a lesser-used path near the hills, its upper works visible while much of it descends into the earth.

## Known Features
- Weathered stonework bearing old dwarven construction marks
- A sloped entry partially flooded during seasonal rains
- Signs of intermittent disturbance: footprints, debris, and smoke stains

## Local Understanding
Most locals believe the site was once a waystation, outpost, or storage hold tied to older valley travel. Its full extent is unknown.

## Rumors
- Some claim it connects to deeper passages beneath the hills
- Others say previous explorers entered but did not return
- A few insist it was sealed intentionally, not abandoned

## Current Status
The structure remains accessible but unexplored in any organized way.

## Resolution Conditions
This situation may change if:
- The site is explored, mapped, or cleared
- Its purpose is rediscovered
- New threats or opportunities emerge from within
- Local authority claims or restricts access
