## Prevalence
Spellcasting is a familiar sight. Minor magical effects are seen weekly to daily in most settled areas and are considered part of ordinary life rather than spectacle.

## Social Presence
Because magic is widespread, its social role is significant, though not always explicit. Spellcasters are present across many layers of society, contributing in varied and sometimes understated ways. Their influence is assumed rather than announced.

## Institutions
Magical institutions exist and thrive, though their internal structure and social reach may vary. Magic is learned, practiced, and shared through both formal and informal means.

## Boundaries
There are no inherent legal or moral restrictions tied to particular schools of magic. Practices such as necromancy are not regarded as intrinsically suspect when compared to other disciplines like divination or evocation.

Concerns about magic arise from context and consequence rather than category.

## Cultural Attitudes
Magic is viewed as a tool or craft rather than a moral statement. Judgments focus on intent, impact, and precedent rather than on the nature of the magic itself.
