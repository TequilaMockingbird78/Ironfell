# Explorer Homeland

id: explorer_homeland_001  
type: origin  
canon: party

## Overview
The explorers hail from a large, temperate land across a vast western ocean.  
It is densely populated and cosmopolitan, with many races living together, though humans are the most prevalent. The land is old, ordered, and deeply shaped by law, memory, and tradition.

## Governance
The homeland is ruled by **The Silent Canon**, a monastic order that governs through precedent, ritual, and written judgment. Spoken words are considered imperfect; decisions are rendered through silence, record, and carefully preserved rulings. Speech is often regarded as the mark of error rather than authority.

## Society
Life in the homeland is structured and literate. Laws are known through study, not proclamation. Disputes are settled by reference to what has already been decided rather than what is argued aloud. Wisdom, restraint, and continuity are prized above ambition or novelty.

## The Western Ocean
To the west lies a vast ocean long believed to be the edge of the world. For generations, ships avoided its depths. A few years prior to day-zero, several merchant vessels were lost attempting westward passage. They were presumed destroyed—until one returned.

Only three people survived that return voyage.

## The Returning Vessel
The survivors claimed to have reached a distant coast across the ocean, a journey of roughly three weeks. Understanding the consequences of such knowledge, and bound by loyalty and fear of upheaval, they spoke only to the Silent Canon. The wider world was not informed.

The monks understood that this discovery could not remain secret forever.

## The Mission
After careful deliberation, the Silent Canon authorized a single exploratory mission:
- **Duration:** One year in the new land (not including travel time)
- **Assets:** One ship, limited supplies, no expectation of resupply
- **Personnel:** A small party of trusted explorers (with provision for others to join if circumstances allow)

The party made landfall on day-zero in the starting region, knowing nothing of the inhabitants, cultures, or dangers they might encounter.

## Encampment
The ship makes landfall on the Western continent and adventure parties embark. Meanwhile the remaining crew form a small little encampment on the shoreline where they will fish and hunt and serve as a place for the adventurine parties to return to. They brought with them a mage, cleric, and potion maker who can provide the party with minor magical items.

## Purpose of Exploration
The Silent Canon values knowledge, memory, and foresight. They believe that discovery without understanding leads to ruin. Their goal is not conquest, but awareness.

They also recognize that other realms of the old world—less restrained, more ambitious—will inevitably seek to exploit any new lands discovered. Knowledge gathered first may prevent catastrophe later.

## Directives Given to the Party
- Learn all that can be learned about the land and its people
- Observe customs, power structures, and beliefs
- If possible, establish peaceful and respectful relations
- Avoid unnecessary conflict or provocation

The party was not sent as conquerors, missionaries, or settlers.

## Expectations and Constraints
- The party is expected to survive, observe, and return if able
- No reinforcements are planned
- Silence is preferable to reckless action
- Failure is understood; recklessness is not

## What the Homeland Does NOT Know
- Whether the new land is inhabited
- Whether its peoples are unified or divided
- Whether magic, religion, or power function similarly there
- Whether the ocean crossing can be repeated reliably

## Notes
This file defines origin, perspective, and restraint—not destiny.  
The future of the new world is unwritten.
