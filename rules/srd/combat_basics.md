id: rules_combat_basics_35e
type: rules
system: dnd35e

## Combat Flow
Combat proceeds in rounds of approximately 6 seconds. Each creature acts once per round in initiative order.

## Actions
On your turn, you may typically take:
- One standard action
- One move action
- One swift action (if available)
You may trade a standard action for an additional move action.

## Attacks
An attack roll is:
d20 + base attack bonus + ability modifier + situational modifiers

If the result equals or exceeds the target’s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits.

## Armor Class (AC)
AC represents how difficult a target is to strike effectively and may include:
- Armor and shield bonuses
- Dexterity modifier (if applicable)
- Size, cover, or magical bonuses

## Damage
On a hit, damage is rolled according to the weapon or effect used and reduced from hit points.

## Threatened Area
Creatures threaten squares they can attack with a melee weapon. Leaving a threatened square may provoke an attack of opportunity.

## Notes
Combat rules resolve *how* actions succeed, not *whether* characters choose them.
